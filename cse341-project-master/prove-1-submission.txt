Please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

1. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub): https://github.com/Jonathan9719/cse341/tree/master/cse341-project-master

3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning. 
    The / username submission
    The /users list of users is working
    The /create-user is working

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.
    the updating of the user list is not working

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
    the back end of what the server does when requests are sent to the server and how it routes the url to certain pieces of code

6. If you could change this assignment to be more effective or helpful, what would you change?
    I can't think of how to make the users list update so maybe a hint towards that?

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
   1 - Some attempt was made
   2 - Developing, but significantly deficient
   3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
   4 - Meets requirements (check)
   5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements

8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
    I met the requirements that were made but I didn't go above and beyond to update the users list. It's late and I still have a few other assignments to accomplish.
